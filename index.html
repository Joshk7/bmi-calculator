                        A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy
                        weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances
                        of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and
                        type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat
                        and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and
                        vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical
                        activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a
                        week.

                Healthy eating Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease
                prevention, better digestion, immunity, mental clarity, and
                mood. Regular exercise Exercise improves fitness, aids weight
                control, elevates mood, and reduces disease risk, fostering
                wellness and longevity. Adequate sleep Sleep enhances mental
                clarity, emotional stability, and physical wellness, promoting
                overall restoration and rejuvenation.

                <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>

                Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight,
                it is not suited for every person. Specific groups should
                carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the
                measurement may not be beneficial to use. Gender The development
                and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age.
                Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when
                evaluating their BMI. Age In aging individuals, increased body
                fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate body fat
                content. Muscle BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as
                overweight or obese, as it doesn't differentiate muscle from
                fat. Pregnancy Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to
                their growing baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is
                advisable to minimise health risks for both mother and child.
                Race Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some
                Black and Asian origins at lower BMIs than others. To learn
                more, it is advised to discuss this with your GP or practice
                nurse.
